# Othello
Our Othello is a board game with two stones played inside a console on a 6 x 6 board. There are 18 **'B'** stones and 18 **'W'** stones that each player must take turns placing them on the board. For every turn, a player must put each stone in a position where it can flip their opponent's disc over. Once all 36 stones are used, a winner is determined based on the most amount of stones a player has placed on the board.

# Technical implementation
Provide a general discussion on the data structures and algorithms that were used to achieve the goals of the project

Othello will use the **minimax alogrithm** for the AI in order to get the best move against the player. 

# Usage
Our game will requires python 3 and numpy to run.
for numpy install instruction, read documentation here https://www.scipy.org/install.html
